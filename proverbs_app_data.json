      "deeper_analysis": "The proverb uses the metaphor of a small injury (cut finger) spreading to others (little finger) to convey how a single problem can escalate when more people get involved. The 'companions' here symbolize those who might not be directly responsible but still contribute to the chaos. For instance, if someone gets into a fight, their friends might jump in, making the situation more violent and unmanageable."

      "actual_translation": "This means that small steps or gradual progress may seem slow, but they are actually more effective and reliable than trying to make big leaps.",
      "deeper_analysis": "The proverb uses the contrast between the small distance between fingers ('ungal ungal neṛe') and the larger distance measured by handspans ('chappa chappa duur') to highlight the importance of steady, incremental progress. It's often used to advise people to focus on making consistent, small efforts rather than trying to make drastic changes that might not be sustainable. For example, if someone is trying to lose weight, this proverb would encourage them to make small, healthy lifestyle changes rather than trying fad diets that might not last."

It suggests that despite achieving success or fame, one will ultimately return to their roots. For example, if someone from a poor family becomes rich and famous, but eventually loses everything and has to go back to their old life, people might say 'ਓੜਕ ਬੱਚਾ ਮੂਲਿਆ ! ਤੂੰ ਹੱਟੀ ਬਹਿਣਾ' to imply that they're back where they started."

The 'small capital' symbolizes the initial investment, while 'eats the owner' represents the devastating losses that can occur. For instance, if someone invests a small amount in a get-rich-quick scheme and ends up losing their entire life savings, this proverb would be used to describe the situation."

It's often used to criticize someone who keeps saying the same thing over and over, without contributing anything new or valuable to the conversation. For example, if a politician keeps promising the same old solutions to a problem without offering any new ideas, people might say 'ohho tun tuni, ohhee raag' to express their frustration."

The phrase 'whose prayers God accepts' signifies that the person has a special connection with the divine. It's often used to advise against rivalry or competition with someone who is exceptionally talented or successful, as it's seen as a futile effort. For example, if someone is trying to outdo a colleague who is exceptionally skilled and has a track record of success, this proverb would caution against such a rivalry, suggesting that it's better to focus on one's own strengths rather than competing with someone who seems to have divine favor."

'Madho' is a common Punjabi name used to add a touch of familiarity. For example, if a friend asks you for financial help, but you're already struggling to make ends meet, you might say this proverb to politely decline their request."

The 'splash' symbolizes the boastful or showy behavior.

The 'rattling' sound represents the empty one's loud and boastful claims, while the 'never wavering' full one is steady and unshakeable.

This proverb is often used to advise against trying to form close relationships with people who are far more influential or powerful than you, as it can lead to disappointment or even exploitation.

The phrase 'ਅੱਤ ਦਾ ਤੇ ਪ੍ਰਮਾਤਮਾ ਦਾ ਵੈਰ ਹੁੰਦਾ ਏ' suggests that an individual's excessive behavior, whether it's pride, greed, or ambition, can lead to their downfall. For example, if someone becomes too proud of their wealth and starts to mistreat others, they may face consequences, such as losing their wealth or respect.

It suggests that even though the wrongdoer might seem to get away with their actions for a long time (a hundred days), ultimately, the good person will be rewarded and their goodness will be recognized (one day). This proverb is often used to console someone who has been wronged, implying that justice will eventually prevail. For example, if someone is being bullied at work, their colleagues might say, 'Don't worry, a hundred days for the thief, one day for the saint,' to reassure them that the bully will eventually face consequences."

      "actual_translation": "This proverb means that people often waste the best opportunities and then regret it.",
      "deeper_analysis": "The proverb uses the four months of the year to symbolize different stages of life. 'Winter' represents the early years of life, full of energy and opportunities ('gold'). 'Harh' symbolizes the prime of life, full of activity and progress ('silver'). 'Saawan' represents the later years, a time for reflection and contemplation. 'Bhadon' is the rainy month, symbolizing the end of life, which is often wasted or regretted. The proverb is used to caution people to make the most of their opportunities, lest they regret it later in life. For example, if someone has a chance to pursue their dream career but procrastinates, they might later regret wasting their prime years."

      "deeper_analysis": "This proverb highlights the difference in how people respond to guidance. The 'hint' symbolizes gentle advice, while the 'stick' represents harsh words or punishment. It's often used to describe how teachers, parents, or leaders need to adapt their communication style to their audience. For instance, a wise student might understand a subtle suggestion from their teacher, but a careless one might require a stern warning."

A wise enemy will test your abilities and make you stronger, whereas a foolish friend might hold you back with their ignorance.

      "deeper_analysis": "The proverb contrasts the lush green forests during the monsoon season of Saawan with the dry, ripe barley. It highlights the difference between appearance and reality. For instance, a person might be going through a tough time in their personal life but still managing to excel in their career, or a business might be struggling financially despite its impressive marketing.

Each month has a specific task associated with it - Saawan brings rain, Katak is for threshing, and Poh is for drinking (enjoying the fruits of labor). The proverb emphasizes the importance of teamwork and coordination. For example, if each member of a team does their job efficiently, the project will be a success.

The 'four days' in Bhadon might be a stretch, but still possible. However, asking for clouds in 'Assu', a month with very little rainfall, is absurd. This proverb is used to criticize people who have unrealistic demands or expectations, like asking for something that's never going to happen. For example, if someone is asking for a job that requires skills they don't have, you might say this proverb to point out the foolishness of their request."

Saawan represents a time of abundance, while Harh symbolizes hardship. The saying emphasizes that only those who take the trouble to care for the buffaloes during the difficult times (Harh) get to enjoy the benefits during the good times (Saawan).

It's like a tease, promising relief but not delivering. The 'neither a roof nor a rafter' part emphasizes the complete lack of usefulness. For example, if someone is bragging about their new smartphone app that doesn't do anything useful, you might say 'ਸਾਵਣ ਦੀ ਝੜੀ, ਨਾ ਕੋਠਾ ਨਾ ਕੜੀ' to express your disappointment."
